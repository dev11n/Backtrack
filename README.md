A simple repository aimed at describing how to bypass several security-focused aspects of Star Stable Online
## Setup
1. Fiddler Everywhere
2. A basic understanding of how Fiddler works (trust the root certificate for HTTP/HTTPS connections, otherwise it won't work)
3. The game itself
4. A VPN is strongly recommended, either iVPN or MullvadVPN. No NordVPN or other bs like that which logs everything.
### Bypassing GameGuard (`2022-05-27`)
1. Launch Fiddler Everywhere
2. Trust the root certificate (`View » Preferences » HTTPS » Trust Root Certificate`)
3. Make sure the Fiddler port is set as `8866` (`View » Preferences » Connections`)
4. Add 3 new rules, here's a table of the information:

| Rule Name                        | Conditions                                                                                                                     | Actions                                                                          | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

5. Done.
